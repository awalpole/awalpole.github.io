                        <p>

                            We have 20+ years experience of working remotely. Many clients have not even been met with in person! With products such as Skype and Tight VNC problems of working remotely are greatly eased.
                            
                            We have experience with medical devices, know something about FDA approval as well as FCC. We have also watched companies make many mistakes, efficiency errors, and reorg's. We can offer you insight into technology, organization structure, technology concept review, projected cost of development, staff capability review, among other things.

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            Adhering to a sound development process is essential for a successful project outcome.

                            We have a solid reputation for producing superior software, on time and within the budget.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Implementation Process for Your Project</h2>
                        <p>
                            <span>Phase 1</span> is a short period which is used to produce an implementation plan, and a schedule for implementation. Phase 1 typically lasts a few days to a week or so depending on the project. You will feel confident that our understanding of your project will lead to a successful implementation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Phase 2</span> is the actual implementation, with additional phases as required.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Pricing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our operating expenses are low so we can pass the savings on to you.  You will not be paying the overhead for fancy office space!

                            The hourly rate depends on the length of the project and several other variables which will be discussed with you.
                            
                            We prefer to do fixed price projects when possible. However, a lot of our work is time and material based.
                            
                            We know how to effectively manage both fixed price and hourly projects!
