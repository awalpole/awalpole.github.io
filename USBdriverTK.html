                    <p>
                            The USB Toolkit is a result of years of developing USB devices using the EZ-USB/Cypress and other vendors USB development tools.  It has specific support for Cypress USB components and will work with USB chips from any vendor (TI, Cygnal, MicroChip, etc.). <br><br>

                            It is designed to speed the development of firmware and provide a stable Windows driver for use with any USB device which does not fit into the USB device classes that Windows supports.<br><br>
                            
                            Full support for Windows asynchronous I/O (otherwise known as overlapped I/O) is provided.<br><br>
                            
                            <span>No DDK development is required.</span>  You don't even have to own the DDK to use the Toolkit.<br><br>
                            
                            Support for Cypress RAM and I2C download is provided for use with the EZ-USB, FX, and FX2 parts.<br><br>
